C++ Programming & Data Structures Notes

This repository is a collection of my personal notes, exercises, and practice code from the textbook "C++ Programming: Program Design Including Data Structures" by D.S. Malik.

It serves as my personal code sandbox for testing concepts and completing exercises as I work through the book. The code here represents my journey in learning and understanding the fundamentals of C++ and core data structures.

Repository Structure

The code is organized into folders based on the C++ concepts or data structures they cover:

/array: Practice with static and dynamic arrays.

/book_exercises: Solutions to various end-of-chapter exercises.

/functions: Examples of C++ functions, parameters, and return types.

/lab4, /lab5, /lab6: Course lab assignments.

/oop: Code demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming principles (classes, inheritance, polymorphism).

/oop/queue: Implementation of a Queue data structure.

/oop/stacks: Implementation of a Stack data structure.

/pointer: Exploring pointers, memory addresses, and dynamic memory.

/recursion: Practice with recursive functions and logic.

/repetition: Examples of for, while, and do-while loops.

/tree: Implementation of tree structures (e.g., Binary Search Trees).

This repository is for personal learning and reference. Code may be in various stages of completion or optimization.
